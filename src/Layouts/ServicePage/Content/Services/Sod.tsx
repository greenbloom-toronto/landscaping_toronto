      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", color: "#02703d", marginBottom: "10px" }}>Seed vs. Sod</h2>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem", lineHeight: "1.6", marginBottom: "16px" }}>
        If you take a handful of seed and place it next to a block of sod then the main difference between seed and sod becomes readily apparent. Sod is actually grass and seed is...well, seed. If you lay sod on a patch of dirt, the sod laid patch will look like lawn. You wonâ€™t be able to walk on it for a while but it will have the aesthetic look of lawn. If you sow seed on a patch of dirt, the seed sowed dirt will still look like dirt until the seeds have germinated and filled out a bit.

        There are two basic advantages of seed over sod. The first is cost. In order to sow seeds, all that is required is that the soil be prepared and then you are set to sow. The costs incurred are simply those of the seed itself, which is negligible, and the cost of labor. Sod costs significantly more per square meter then the requisite amount of seed to cover the same area and also requires more soil preparation. The other advantage to seed over sod is that the grass seeds can be selected that best suit the conditions of your yard. With sod, you are limited to the types of sod available on the market.
